# Python best practices

- using Flask for Python web development, since it is established Python framework for web development
- try to keep code simple to avoid errors but complex enough to solve given task
- code documentation (given application is simple, so comments are enough)
- using `if __name__ == "__main__":` (it protects users from accidentally invoking the script when they didn't intend to)
